I think I am using 1.7.1 Git
	Need to figure out what is in 1.7.4 if there are any differences

Get vetting from someone on the history of version control systems
Come up with more breakout boxes :)
Come up with more items for terminology

%git log -p

%git show master:<path>
%git diff -- stylesheet.css master:stylesheet.css

% git show v1.0.0^{tree}

% make simon have changed a pw which broke things...this is to use bisect
% then they discover pw in repo

% filter branch to move project to new dir

%wmctrl -r Gui -e 0,0,0,811,500

Neeeed to talk about .gitignore
