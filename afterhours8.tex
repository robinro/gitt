\subsection{Hooking your scripts up}
So we come to the last After Hours section of the book and this time we are going to take a look at hook scripts.
Hook scripts are tiny pieces of code that you are allowed to have executed at certain points during Git's processes which can affect the outcome of those same processes.
Imagine for example that whenever you committed to a repository you wanted an email to be sent to the project manager.
That is a job for a hook script.

The are a fairly large number of hook points available.
They are called hooks because it allows you to hook something else into the Git process.
Below is a list of the available hook points along with a very brief description of when they are triggered and how they can affect the process.

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{applypatch-msg} - Invoked by \texttt{git am}, it is provided with the name of the proposed commit message for the patch and allows for sanitisation.
Exiting with a non-zero status will cause \texttt{git am} to abort the patch.
Will run the \textbf{commit-msg} hook if enabled.
\item\textbf{pre-applypatch} - Invoked by \texttt{git am}, it runs immediately after the patch is applied, but before a commit is made.
In this way, checks can be made to the working tree before committing.
Exiting with non-zero status aborts the commit.
Will run the \textbf{pre-commit} hook if enabled.
\item\textbf{post-applypatch} - Invoked by \texttt{git am}, it runs after the patch is applied and the commit is made.
It can not affect the flow of \texttt{git am} and as such is useful for actions such as notifications.
\item\textbf{pre-commit} - This hook is invoked by \texttt{git commit} and can be bypassed with the \texttt{--no-verify} option.
Exiting with non-zero status aborts the commit.
\item\textbf{prepare-commit-msg} - This hook is invoked by \texttt{git commit} and is run immediately after the commit message has been prepared, but before the message editor has been loaded.
It takes three parameters, the file containing the log message, the source of the commit message and an SHA hash.
Exiting with non-zero status aborts the commit.
It should not be used to replace \textbf{pre-commit}.
\item\textbf{commit-msg} - This hook is invoked by \texttt{git commit} and can be bypassed with the \texttt{--no-verify} option.
The hook is used to normalise messages in place before commit.
Exiting with non-zero status aborts the commit.
\item\textbf{post-commit} - Invoked by \texttt{git commit}, it runs immediately after a commit is made.
It can not affect the flow of \texttt{git commit} and as such is useful for actions such as notifications.
\item\textbf{pre-rebase} - Invoked by \texttt{git rebase}, it is useful for preventing a branch from being rebased.
\end{itemize}
